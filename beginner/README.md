# 🟢 Beginner Projects

This folder contains my **first Python projects**, focused on learning the basics.  
Here you’ll find simple scripts where I practiced:
- Input & Output
- Loops & Conditions
- Basic error handling

## 📌 Projects

- **calculator.py** → My first calculator app (handles +, -, *, /, %, **)
- **rps.py** → My Rock/Paper/Scissors game

## 📝 Note
These projects may look simple, but they are the **foundation** of my Python learning journey.
