# 🔴 Advanced Projects

This folder will contain my **advanced Python projects**, where I focus on larger applications and more complex code.  
These projects will explore:
- Web development with Flask/Django
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Larger codebases with multiple files
- Projects closer to production-level applications
