# 🐍 Python Journey  

This repository is a collection of my Python projects, exercises, and experiments.  
I created it to track my progress as I learn programming, improve my skills, and build cool things along the way.  

## 📌 What you'll find here
- Beginner practice scripts  
- Small projects (games, tools, utilities)  
- Step-by-step improvements as I level up  

## 🎯 Goal
To document my journey from beginner to advanced in Python.  
By uploading everything, I can look back and see how much I’ve improved over time.  

## 🤝 Contributions
This repo is mainly for my personal growth, but feedback, tips, and suggestions are always welcome!
